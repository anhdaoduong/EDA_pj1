# In the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the given dataset, several key tasks will be performed:
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identify and handle missing values.
   - Remove duplicates or irrelevant entries.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for numerical columns like prices and ratings.
   - Analyze categorical variables (e.g., product categories) to determine their distribution.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations (histograms, bar charts, box plots) to illustrate the distribution of prices, ratings, and discount percentages.
   - Use scatter plots to explore relationships between variables, such as discounted price vs. actual price.
4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Assess correlations between numerical features (e.g., rating and discount percentage) to identify potential relationships.
5. **Review Analysis**:
   - Analyze review titles and content for sentiment, using techniques like word clouds or sentiment scoring.
   - Examine the distribution of ratings and review counts to understand customer feedback patterns.
6. **Discount Effectiveness**:
   - Evaluate the impact of discount percentages on sales (if applicable) and customer ratings.
7. **Category Insights**:
   - Compare performance metrics (like average rating, average discount) across different product categories.
8. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Identify any outliers in pricing or ratings and investigate their causes.
Overall, EDA will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, highlighting trends, relationships, and areas for further analysis.
